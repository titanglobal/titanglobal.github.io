            To Provide Services to You:
            We may use your information to provide you the Titan Global Offerings and our other services.  We may use your username, email address, and password to uniquely identify you as a user of a Titan Global Offering, to provide you with services and to process transactions.

If you choose to provide a username within a Titan Global Offering, please do not provide as your username any information that identifies you in real life, such as your real name.  We may use your date of birth to confirm your eligibility to participate in Titan Global Offerings.</p>

            <p>Advertising Purposes:
            Subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we may use your contact information to process our promotional newsletters and/or email campaigns and to send you updates, security alerts, or administrative messages relating to Titan Global Offerings. Your contact information will allow us to notify you about new features, enhancements, resolution of Titan Global Offerings problems, handle and/or route your customer support questions and issues, and inform you of upgrade opportunities, sweepstakes, contests, prizes, and/or special events.</p>

            <p>If our “Tell a friend” feature is available within a particular Titan Global Offering and you choose to participate in it, your email will be shared with the person to whom you send the Titan Global Offering using this feature. We may use an IP address to surface the appropriate country-based version of a Titan Global Offering to a user, or to exercise our ability to restrict access to the site by users who have violated our Terms of Use.</p>

            <p>We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other technologies, such as mobile device identifiers, to enhance your experience with Titan Global Offerings. These technologies enable us and our service providers to run our affiliate programs and provide you with customized content or offerings, such as personalized Titan Global advertisements on other websites, devices and mobile applications and personalized third-party advertisements within certain Titan Global Offerings. Cookies also enable you to automatically sign in when you access a Titan Global Offering, and offer other operational activities within a Titan Global Offering. We and our third-party service providers may also use cookies and other technologies to manage and measure the performance of third-party advertisements within certain Titan Global Offerings, and Titan Global advertisements on third party sites and mobile applications. This helps us and our service providers provide more relevant advertising to you. We and our third-party service providers may also use web beacons and other technologies to monitor user behavior and collect information about visitors viewing a web page.</p>

            <p>Product Improvement and Security:
            We may use information collected to compile statistics and conduct analysis about our user community for the purpose of enhancing our Titan Global Offerings, or for security purposes.</p>

            <p>Linking with Social Networks:
            If you access a Social Game, we may use your social networking site profile ID to link your social networking site account with your activities within the Social Game or offer personalized Titan Global advertisements on the social networking site. We may use your social networking site first, last and user names and icon to identify you to the social networking site account you’ve linked to your activities within the Social Game, as well as for the purposes of rankings, competitions, sweepstakes, game high scores and/or identification to your social network.</p>

            <p>If you access a Social Game and provide us with another person’s contact information for purposes of delivering information through a Social Game, we may use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that she or he has been invited to join a Social Game or received content through a Social Game. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Titan Global.</p>

            <p>SECURITY
            We at Titan Global take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist in safeguarding your personal data, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

            <p>SHARING INFORMATION</p>

            <p>We may share the categories of information described above with Titan Global Affiliates, other companies of the Aristocrat Group to which Titan Global belongs, and as described below.</p>

            <p>Third Party Marketplaces and Service Providers:
            We may disclose your personal information to third party business partners, marketplaces, and third parties who perform services for us, such as credit card processing, prize fulfillment, delivering packages, sending postal mail, collecting and analyzing data, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing advertising and marketing assistance, including serving ads on our behalf on third party websites and mobile applications and serving ads on behalf of third parties within certain Titan Global Offerings.</p>

            <p>Business Transfers:
            As Titan Global continues to grow, we might sell or buy certain subsidiaries and/or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Titan Global or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information would in most cases be one of the transferred assets.</p>

            <p>Protection of Titan Global and Others:
            We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the Terms of Use or other agreements; if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it; or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of Titan Global, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with entities for fraud detection and protection, and credit risk reduction as well as in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

            <p>California Consumer Privacy Act and Additional Legal Disclosures:
            As described above, Titan Global shares information for the business purposes that are described and allows third parties to access information about your use of the Titan Global Offerings through cookies and other tracking technologies.  While we provide you the choices described in our Cookie Policy, we do not treat these relationships as “sales” of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).  To learn about how Google processes your information and what choices you may have, visit their site here.</p>

            <p>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
            Depending on where you live, you also may have rights to request that we delete personal information that Titan Global holds about you, to request that we provide such information to you in a portable format, or to request additional information about how we collect or disclose your personal information.</p>

            <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices except where permitted by law.  For example, some of the functionality and features available on the Titan Global Offerings may change or no longer be available to you if you have requested that we delete your information.</p>

            <p>Once we receive your request, we may verify it through your account or by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to exercise rights on your behalf.</p>

            <p>Promotional Email Communications:
            Unless you are located in the EU or certain other jurisdictions, when you create a customer account or provide access to your email address via a Titan Global Offering, you may be automatically registered to receive one or more of our promotional e- newsletters.</p>

            <p>Note that when you provide an email address through a Titan Global Offering, we treat that as a request to be enrolled in one of our promotional e-newsletter lists, even if you previously opted out of receiving newsletters from us. If you change your mind and wish to opt out again, you may do so at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any newsletter and then following the instructions provided. If you express interest in a Titan Global Offering by clicking on a banner within a newsletter, you may be automatically registered to receive newsletters relating to the Titan Global Offering that appeared in the banner.</p>

            <p>At any time, you may opt-out of receiving a newsletter by selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any newsletter. We treat each Titan Global Offering individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one Titan Global Offering, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so with respect to each individually or you can unsubscribe universally by contacting us at teamtitansvn@gmail.com. Please note that we reserve the right to send you non-promotional, account or administrative emails even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-newsletters.</p>

            <p>Mobile Advertising:
            Most mobile devices provide the ability to opt out of the collection and use of information from the apps you use for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests. For more information, and to exercise these choices, consult the settings on your device.</p>

            <p>THIRD-PARTIES
            Titan Global Offerings may allow you to play or direct Titan Global to share information through social media (such as by logging in through a social media account or using a “Like” button”) or contain links to social media services or other third parties. The use of these features and links are subject to the privacy policies of those companies and your settings on those services. Titan Global has no control over, and is not responsible for, the information submitted to or collected by social networks or other third parties. We encourage you to review those third-party privacy policies to understand the way your information may be collected and handled by such third parties.</p>

            <p>CHAT &amp; MESSAGING
            Titan Global Offerings may operate message boards and/or chat areas where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting to a message board or chat area, the information is being made publicly available in an online environment. Any information posted is the sole responsibility of the individual user.</p>

            <p>CHILDREN
            Titan Global Offerings are generally designed for users who are at least 13 years of age and older and therefore such Offerings generally do not knowingly collect or make use of “personal information” as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) from children under 13, except as consistent with applicable law.</p>

            <p>Some Titan Global Offerings may allow children under 13 to participate in certain activities or gain access to limited gameplay or features within an application, but these offerings are designed to collect only certain device identifiers from children under 13 and use those identifiers solely for purposes that support the internal operations of those offerings or as otherwise permitted by law. We do not knowingly allow children under 13 (16 in the EU) years old to register for an account or otherwise provide any personal information to us, and we do not collect or use personal information from children under 13 for targeted advertising purposes.</p>

            <p>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
            We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last modified” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how Titan Global protects your information. If we make a change that we deem material, we may provide you additional notice.</p>
